## Download

Check out the [guide page](https://locaal-ai.github.io/obs-backgroundremoval) for downloads and install instructions for **Windows** and **MacOS**.

### Linux Installation

On Ubuntu, there are two ways to install OBS and you have to use the corresponding method to install this plugin.

- If you installed OBS via the official PPA, download the deb package from the [releases](https://github.com/locaal-ai/obs-backgroundremoval/releases) page and install it directly.
- If you installed OBS via FlatHub, run the following command: `flatpak install com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.BackgroundRemoval`

The pre-built binary of this plugin can run Ubuntu 22.04 or later.

On openSUSE, please see [`docs/BUILDING-OPENSUSE.md`](docs/BUILDING-OPENSUSE.md).

#### FlatHub

On Debian, you cannot use our deb package and we only support FlatHub installation.

On other Linux distros, use the FlatHub installation of both OBS and this plugin.

```
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub com.obsproject.Studio
flatpak install flathub com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.BackgroundRemoval
```

If you install OBS in a way other than FlatHub, you have to build this plugin by yourself (see instructions for building [below](#linux)).

### OBS Version Support and Compatibility

- OBS version 29+ ([download](https://obsproject.com/download)) for the latest version of this plugin, e.g. 1.1.x and above.
- OBS version 28+ for this plugin's version between 0.5.x and 1.0.x.
- OBS version 27+ for this plugin's version 0.4.x and below.

## Introduction

This plugin is meant to make it easy to replace the background in portrait images and video.
It is using a neural network to predict the mask of the portrait and remove the background pixels.
It's easily composable with other OBS plugins to replace the background with e.g. an image or
a transparent color.

### Technical Details

GPU support:

- Currently on Windows we support DirectML, which should reduce CPU usage by 95% and effectively use the systems accelerators (GPUs if available).
- On Mac we support CoreML for acceleration, which is available on M1 and M2 (not Intel, sorry).
- CUDA is supported in this plugin through TensorRT, however it is supported only on Linux.
- The goal of this plugin is to be available for everyone on every system, even if they don't own a GPU.

Number of CPU threads is controllable through the UI settings. A 2-thread setting works best.

## Building

The plugin was built and tested on Mac OSX (Intel & Apple silicon), Windows and several Linux disros (e.g. Ubuntu/Debian-ish, Fedora, and more). Help is appreciated in building on other OSs and packages.

The building pipelines in CI take care of the heavy lifting. Use them in order to build the plugin locally. We attempt to use external OpenCV, libcurl and ONNX Runtime to reduce build times.

Start by cloning this repo to a directory of your choice.

### Mac OSX

Using the CI pipeline scripts, locally you would just call the zsh script. By default this builds a universal binary for both Intel and Apple Silicon. To build for a specific architecture please see `.github/scripts/.build.zsh` for the `-arch` options.

```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/build-macos -c Release
```

#### Install

The above script should succeed and the plugin files (e.g. `obs-backgroundremoval.plugin`) will reside in the `./release/Release` folder off of the root. Copy the `.plugin` file to the OBS directory e.g. `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins`.

To get `.pkg` installer file, run for example

```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/package-macos -c Release
```

(Note that maybe the outputs will be in the `Release` folder and not the `install` folder like `pakage-macos` expects, so you will need to rename the folder from `build_x86_64/Release` to `build_x86_64/install`)

### Linux

#### Ubuntu

Use the CI scripts again

```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/build-linux.sh
```

#### Arch Linux

The community maintains AUR packages: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obs-backgroundremoval

#### Fedora

To compile on Fedora, you need to manage the dependencies manually. See [docs/BUILDING-FEDORA.md](docs/BUILDING-FEDORA.md) for more information.

#### FlatHub

The plugin is available on FlatHub: https://github.com/flathub/com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.BackgroundRemoval

```sh
$ flatpak install com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.BackgroundRemoval
```

### Windows

Use the CI scripts again, for example:

```powershell
> .github/scripts/Build-Windows.ps1 -Target x64 -CMakeGenerator "Visual Studio 17 2022"
```

The build should exist in the `./release` folder off the root. You can manually install the files in the OBS directory.
